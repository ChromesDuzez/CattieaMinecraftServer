## Notable Server Additions
- Simple-Proximity Voice Chat
    - AudioPlayer (custom music disc and goat horn sounds)
    - voice chat interactions (audio over proximity voice chat affects in game things such as skulk sensors)
- Simple Party and Claims (Provides a UI for easier claiming and configuring instead of using commands)
- VoxelMap or Xaero's Minimap depending on preference (Xaero's Minimap has integration with simple claims showing which chunks are claimed)
- The status mod to let people know whether you wish to be disturbed or not and if you are streaming/recording and if you wish people to sleep or not during night
- Armor Statues Datapack to let you transform you building to a new level and make them feel alive
- The server's [Resource Pack](https://github.com/ChromesDuzez/CattieahJediTempleMCserver/blob/main/VanillaTweaks_ServerResourcePack1.20.x.zip) (aka Texture Pack) from Vanilla Tweaks
